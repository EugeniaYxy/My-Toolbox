This challenge demonstrates a new Chart library 


It is specifically used for developers to visualize their data, specifically here refering to the recent customers' different feedbacks 


There are a few limitations of this new library, as it can only show a limited amount of data, so it makes merchants harder to compare more datas. I think only a few data analysis projects will need the bar charts, as bar charts only can show a few examples and also only show direct data collections without any analysis 

Also the last commit was updated 9 days ago, which i think it's still up-to-date. However, there aare 394 open issues but people still respond quickly to solve most of the issues.  


I think one thing good about this new library is that users can easily and directly get from the different ratings from the chart. Specificlly, they can know how many people choose 5 stars and how many choose 4 stars, which directly show the differences between these two choices from bar chart, rather than see the average ratings. 


In order to run the code, users just need to download a chart library cdn:
